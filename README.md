SmartLog
========

A Debugging utility with the following features:
 - The usual features provided by Log class wrapped around by LogMode.
 - Method Entry-Exit logs: Can be turned off by a switch
 - Selective Debugging: Debug specific classes.
 - Method Execution-Time Measurement: Measure Execution time for individual methods as well as collective time spent on all methods of a class.
 
 How To Use? 
  - Include the class in your project. 
  - Use it like you use android.util.Log methods, to start with.
  - Use the Entry-Exit logs feature by placing calls to entry_log()-exit_log() methods at the beginning and ending of methods in your app. 
  - I have tried to make the documentation self sufficient.
